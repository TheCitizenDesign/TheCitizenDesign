üöÄ **Explore My Repositories:**

* **Repository 1-- Personalized News Recommendation Engine:**
* This project is a personalized news recommendation engine that leverages a hybrid filtering approach to suggest relevant articles from popular news sources. By combining collaborative and content-based filtering, the system provides tailored recommendations to Twitter users based on:

* **Collaborative Filtering:** Analyzing the reading history of similar Twitter users with shared interests.
* **Content-Based Filtering:**  Evaluating the similarity between the article's content and the user's tweets.

This hybrid approach ensures that users receive news recommendations that are both popular among their peers and aligned with their individual preferences expressed through their Twitter activity.
* **Repository 2-- Aircraft Engine Predictive Maintenance:** 

This project focuses on predicting aircraft engine failure 50 cycles in advance using a combination of advanced machine learning models.  The project involved:

    Predictive Modeling: Implementing RNN, LSTM, and 1D-CNN models to forecast engine failures.
    Feature Importance Analysis: Utilizing sensitivity analysis and SHAP values to identify critical factors contributing to engine failure.
    Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation: Applying exponential degradation and similarity-based models to estimate the remaining lifespan of aircraft engines.

This approach enables proactive maintenance scheduling, reduces downtime, and improves aircraft safety by anticipating potential engine failures well in advance.
* **Repository 3 Wind Turbine Power Curve Estimation:** 
In this project, I have employed regression techniques to estimate the Power curve of an on-shore Wind turbine. Nonlinear trees based regression methods perform best as true power curve is nonlinear. XGBoost is implemented and optimized using GridSearchCV which yields lowest Test RMSE-6.404.

* **Repository 4 Multivariate Phase 1 Analysis for Manufacturing Process Control** 

This project aims to establish robust statistical process control for manufacturing by identifying and eliminating out-of-control data points.  The key steps involved:

**Data Cleaning:**  Analyzing multivariate data to identify and remove outliers and anomalies, ensuring a reliable baseline for process monitoring.
**Dimension Reduction:** Utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensionality and extract key features.
**Control Chart Implementation:** Employing Hotelling T2 and MCUSUM control charts to establish mean and variance matrices for ongoing process monitoring.

This rigorous Phase 1 analysis ensures that the manufacturing process operates within acceptable limits, improving product quality and consistency.


* **Repository 5 Loan Default Prediction:** 
This project developed a highly accurate model to predict loan defaults, enabling proactive risk management and informed lending decisions. The project involved:

* **Data Analysis and Preprocessing:** Analyzing loan applicant data and addressing class imbalance using the SMOTE technique.
* **Model Development and Evaluation:**  Implementing and evaluating various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LightGBM.
* **Performance Optimization:** Achieving superior prediction accuracy (98.89%) and F1-score (0.99) using a tuned LightGBM model.

This predictive model empowers lenders to identify high-risk applicants, minimize potential losses, and optimize loan portfolio management.

**I'm always eager to collaborate on exciting data engineering and AI projects. Feel free to reach out!**
